# Context Recognition
## Getting Started  (Windows 10)

1. Install [python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3912/).
    Alternatively, you can install python using [anaconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2022.10-Windows-x86_64.exe) or [miniconda](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-py39_23.1.0-1-Windows-x86_64.exe).

2.  Clone or download this repository and set it as the working directory, create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.
In the project download directory, open a Command Prompt (or Anaconda Prompt) and type:

    ```
    cd context_recognition\ 
    python -m venv wic
    wic\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
3. Find and open the Command/Anaconda Prompt and navigate to the desired folder, using the cd command. Once in the desired folder, type "jupyter notebook" followed by the Enter key. The Jupyter server will start. You should see some server logs printed. Shortly after, a browser window should open, showing the files and folders located in the folder where you started the Jupyter server (e.g.  ~/wic). You can now open the notebooks and start the exercise.
